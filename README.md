Add all yours email:pass to ./Files and make sure they are formated like this:

First line:
'### id of a chat it can be in, id of a chat it can be in2, etc'
email:password
email:password
etc.

For links it's the same, but not email:password, just the link of what you want to add.

The bot reloads all it's file on startup.

If you want to add a file, there is nothing's easier : just create a file in the folder(links or combos) with the name of the command, spotify for example and add yours lines as indicated above, it will automatically add the command in help command.
